# README (Missions)
# This README contains instructions to create Missions.

# To add a Mission, you have to create a Infofile in this directory.
# Name the File
#	-"hum_mission_X.inf"
#	-"sha_mission_X.inf"
#	-"both_mission_X.inf"
#
# Where X is a Number from 0 to infinit.


# The File must(!) contain the following Infos:
#
# Name=
# Description=
# IconLoaction=
# MapLocation=
#

# NOTE: Im not sure if you can cancel a linebreak with \\n at the Moment.
#	This may have to be implemented in the Furture from the Info-
#	Loader, to write a better Readable Description (Descriptions
#	sometimes getting very long).

# When you are finished, than the StoryScreen should atomatically load and show your Mission.
